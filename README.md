This is a simple gym website that I had made by using HTML and CSS only.
It is also my first project, so..i am very proud of it.

The first thing you will see here is the Home page whose background is an image, with a translucent navigation bar and a logo.
Now there is also a form asking you to join our gym, and a Submit button, which when cilcked, says thanks and another button saying Go Back.
There are also two more buttons in the top-right corner asking to log in and sign up. So when you click on sign up, it will show some text and 
when you scroll down a little bit you will see a form and two buttons saying Sign Up and Go back, when you click on Sign up it will show Thanks
and another button saying Go to the home page. And when you click on go back, it will bring you back to the home page.
Now comes the Log in button. When you click on it, it will show you Log In now, and when you scroll down a little bit 
you will see a form and two buttons saying Lod in and Go back, when you click on Log in, it wil show thanks and a Get Back button. Now when you click on
The go back button, it will bring you back on the home page.

Now the second page on the navbar is the Fitness Page, so when you will click on Fitness, a new page will open whose background is a linear-gradient
and giving knowledge about fitness; But the best part of it is the font, because the font is thin and just completely blending into the background.

Now when you click on the Contact US page, it will show another page saying Contact Us in a thin font, and when you scroll down a little bit you will see an image.
And when you look at the side of the image, you will see another form and a Send now button which when clicked, says Thanks, and a link to go back to the home page.

When you click on the About Us page it will show another page saying some points about this website in a thin font.

Well, that was it about my whole website i will make more stuff like that in future and Thank You.
